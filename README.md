# 🗂️ Blockchain-Based eVault for Legal Records

A decentralized and secure system for storing, managing, and verifying legal documents using **Blockchain technology** and **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**. This project eliminates document tampering, unauthorized access, and dependency on centralized authorities in legal record management.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional legal document management systems rely on centralized databases, making them vulnerable to:

* Document tampering
* Unauthorized access and data breaches
* Single points of failure
* Time-consuming verification processes

There is a strong need for a **tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized solution** to manage sensitive legal records.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The **Blockchain-Based eVault for Legal Records** provides:

* Immutable storage of document hashes on the blockchain
* Decentralized document storage using IPFS
* Secure verification of document authenticity
* Elimination of third-party intermediaries
* Improved transparency and trust in legal workflows

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

**Key Components:**

* **User Interface (UI):** Upload, view, verify, and manage legal documents
* **Blockchain Layer:** Stores cryptographic hashes of documents
* **IPFS:** Decentralized storage for actual document files
* **MetaMask:** Secure wallet integration for blockchain transactions

**Workflow:**

1. User uploads a legal document
2. Document is encrypted and stored on IPFS
3. A cryptographic hash (SHA-256) is generated
4. Hash is stored on the blockchain
5. Verification is done by comparing hashes

---

## 🔐 Key Features

* Secure document upload and encryption
* Tamper-proof document verification
* Decentralized storage (no single point of failure)
* Transparent and auditable records
* MetaMask wallet integration
* Chatbot support for legal assistance
* Document analytics dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Blockchain & Storage

* **Ethereum**
* **Solidity (Smart Contracts)**
* **IPFS**

### Web Development

* **React.js** – Frontend
* **Node.js** – Backend

### Tools
